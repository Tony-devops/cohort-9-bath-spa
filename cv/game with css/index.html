        <h3> Once upon a time, there was this crazy Magus. Well he was very smart but since no one could understand him, it was easier to call him crazy.</h3>
        <p> Well to cut a long story short (pun intended) he realised long before others that the magical world of computers and games would be where he would find his real friends. People who would be as crazy or smart to seek others like themselves and create the environment they sought. So come join us on this magical journey to find yourself and if the force is with you, maybe make some friends for life on the way</p>
        <p>Did we forget to mention that the Devil is in the Detail?<br> Oops. Apologies.<br> You see the Crazy Magus has to seek out the ones who really wish to be part of his home.<br> So.... he has some "Pre-Steps" he needs you to clear before he gives you access to his Home and allows you to become part of it.</p>
