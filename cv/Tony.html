        I have over 14 years’ experience working in hospitality, primarily at a management level.  Having completed my hotel training in Switzerland and India,
        I secured positions in numerous hotel chains including the 5* Grand Hyatt and Taj Palace hotel’s and the DeVere hotel group.<br> Since 2014 I had been the director of my own company which deals in Retail and Wholesale on the world wide web.
        I have recently completed my Master of Business Administration with Merit from Aston University, Birmingham.<br>
    The aim moving forward is to pivot my skills along with the Full Stack Developer training to become a product manager in a Tech role.
